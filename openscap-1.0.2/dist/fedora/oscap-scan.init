# description:  This service runs OpenSCAP security scanner to check the \

#		stored in /var/log/oscap-scan.xml.log

# processname: /usr/bin/oscap
# config: /etc/sysconfig/oscap-scan
#
# Return values according to LSB for all commands but status:
# 0 - success
# 1 - generic or unspecified error
# 2 - invalid or excess argument(s)
# 3 - unimplemented feature (e.g. "reload")
# 4 - insufficient privilege
# 5 - program is not installed
# 6 - program is not configured
# 7 - program is not running
