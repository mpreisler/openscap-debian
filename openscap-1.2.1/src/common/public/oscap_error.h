 * Error checking mechanism. Purse of this mechanism is to inform user about problems that occured 
 * during executaion of library functions. Mechanism is similar to linux errno variable. When the problem 
 * raise, the information about it is stored in library buffer. This information consists of error family,
 * and textual description. Example of usage:
 *
 * @code
 * syschar = oval_probe_object_eval (pctx, object);
 * if (syschar == NULL && oscap_err()) {
 *     printf("Error: (%d) %s\n", oscap_err_family(), oscap_err_desc());
 * }
 * oscap_clearerr()
 * @endcode
